# Sonatype Nexus IQ Plugin for VS Code

[![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/sonatypecommunity.vscode-iq-plugin?color=blue&label=VS%20Marketplace&logo=visual-studio-code&style=flat-square)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonatypeCommunity.vscode-iq-plugin)

Scan your libraries against either the free [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) vulnerability database or the [Sonatype Nexus IQ Server](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-iq-server). Drill down into all of your dependencies to examine each package version for security vulnerabilities. With IQ Server, it also provides policy and license details.[](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/vscode-iq-plugin)

## Features

- Scan npm, Maven, RubyGems, Go (`dep` and `go mod`), R (see known quirks) or PyPi projects (Go is only supported on Linux or OS/X)
- See all components, with vulnerable ones highlighted

### Sonatype Nexus IQ Scan

### OSS Index Scan

### Themes

## Requirements

- To enable the IQ scan, you will need a Sonatype Nexus IQ Lifecycle license, but the OSS Index scan will work for all users
- The plugin requires npm/yarn, golang, maven, or python and pip to be installed, depending on which language you are using. It will not install these as a part of the plugin

## Extension Settings

- Configuration is done in the VSCode `Preferences > Settings > Sonatype Explorer`

If you are using IQ Server, you can enter your password which will be stored in cleartext, or for additional security you can leave this blank and whenever you start VS Code (and if you have the Nexus Explorer Data Source set to `iqServer`) you will be prompted for a password:

If you are using IQ Server v76 or above, you can create a [user token](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/automating/rest-apis/user-token-rest-api---v2) and save this in the password field instead. The added benefit of doing this is that you are not storing your IQ Server password in plaintext, but rather a user token that can be deleted, etc... if need be.

### Known Quirks

We try to use other tooling whenever possible, to avoid reinventing the wheel (that's what Open Source is about anyways, right!). However, due to using this tooling, we are at the mercy of it, sometimes, so here's a list of quirks we've ran into while developing/using this extension ourself.

#### npm/yarn

- We read the actual dependencies you have installed, which means we parse your node_modules folder. If this folder doesn't exist, we won't find any dependencies! Make sure to run `npm i` or `yarn` on your project if you haven't done so already.

#### RubyGems

- We parse the `Gemfile.lock` file, so if you don't have one, you won't see any dependencies!
- If your `Gemfile.lock` has no specs in it, we will not show any dependencies.

#### Golang

##### go mod

- Golang support depends on an installation of Golang
- We run `go list -m all` to get your dependency list
- This includes test dependencies, so it might be noisy
- It would seem due to this running in VS Code, it runs in a slightly different shell/user, and thus it downloads your dependencies. We set this to `/tmp/gocache` in code, which may not work on Windows (PRs welcome!), so it might be slowish on its first run

##### dep

- We parse the `Gopkg.lock` toml file provided by `dep`
- Some `dep` versions do not use `semver`, so unless you are using a version that looks like `1.0.0` etc... you won't get results from OSS Index or IQ Server
- `dep` support works on Windows/OS X/Linux, as we are not running any OS specific commands

#### R (Cran)

- R support depends on R being available, and your project needs a `.Rbuildignore` file otherwise we cannot determine it's an R project
- This extension also runs an R script to get your installed packages (currently the best way we know of to do this), the way we get these can be seen at `scripts/installed.r` in our GitHub repo
- The way the R script runs, it finds all of the packages you've installed in the R environment, so not just for your project. This is because there is really no way to query for project specific packages, and appears to be a limitation of R.

#### Various and Sundry

- "My project has 3,000 dependencies, why is this so slow?!?". We chunk up requests to OSS Index (free solution) in sections of 128 dependencies, so for 3,000 dependencies, you are making 24 https POST requests for information, and then it's merging those results, etc... We'd love to know your feedback on the tool, so if you do run into this, open up an issue and let us know! Same goes for IQ Server, there could be quite a bit to process.

## Development

Development requires running this project in Visual Studio Code, for ease of testing etc...

You'll need a working version of nodejs (we have been using 10.x and higher), and then:

```
npm i
```

Then:

```
npm run build
```

Then:

`Debug > Start Debugging`

If you are working on functionality that requires IQ Server, you'll need an instance running, and configured in the settings for the project. OSS Index should work right out of the box.

All of the React specific code can be found in `src`. The rest of the code is contained within `ext-src` and this is what communicates with either OSS Index or IQ Server.

We highly suggest installing "Webview Developer Tools" for this project, as the front end is written in React, and it's nice to have that to see what's going on.

## Contributing

We care a lot about making the world a safer place, and that's why we created this extension. If you as well want to speed up the pace of software development by working on this project, jump on in! Before you start work, create a new issue, or comment on an existing issue, to let others know you are!

## Releasing

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to generate releases. For example,
to perform a "patch" release, add a commit to master with a comment like:

```
fix: `policyViolations of undefined` when loading a python project with requirements.txt (see Issue #127) 
```

Without such a commit comment, commits to the `master` branch will cause a build failure during the release
process due to an attempted to reuse an existing version number.

To avoid such build failures without performing a release, be sure your commit message includes `[skip ci] `.

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

- Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
- Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to this Visual Studio Code extension in regard to this project
- DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this extension and the [Sonatype OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/), we are glad to have you here!
