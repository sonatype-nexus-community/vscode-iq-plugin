# vscode-iq-plugin
To run:
The plugin will create a new panel in your IDE called "Nexus IQ". It will automatically evaluate your components.

Currently it is limited to analyzing NPM projects.

Under the covers it does
1) Looks for a package.json
2) Performs a npm shrinkwrap
3) Submits an evaluation report to NexusIQ for the identified components
4) Creates a new panel called Nexus IQ in your VS Code Explorer.
5) Displays the components in the Nexus IQ PANEL

## Requirements
You will need a Sonatype Nexus IQ Lifecycle License to be able to use this extension.


## Extension Settings
* Configuration is done in the VSCode Preferences > Settings
![VSCode Settings](media/Settings.png)

* Filter for NexusIQ and then make your changes
![NexusIQ Settings](media/nexusiq_settings.png)

This extension contributes the following settings, all are required:

* `nexusiq.url`: URL including port of the Nexus IQ server
* `nexusiq.username`: Your Nexus IQ user name
* `nexusiq.password`: Your Nexus IQ Internal ApplicationId
* `nexusiq.applicationPublicId`: Your Nexus IQ Application Public Id

## Known Issues
* You have to specify the Application Public Id and Application Internal UUID, this is a pain. I will create a GUI for this when I get to it. For now you have to work out your UUID. Call this end point to find the UUID - /api/v2/applications.
* Password is stored in plain text
* Styling of the Info panel needs some work

## Adding a format
1) Run `FORMAT=Maven npm run generate-format`, substituting the value for FORMAT for the name of the Format you are working on, example: `Maven` in this case
2) Implement the methods you need to in these newly generated classes, and then in `ext-src/packages/ComponentContainer.ts`, add your Implementation!
