# Generating a format using magic

Hi! We keep these mustache templates around so it's easier to add a format to the VS Code IQ Extension.

To use the code generation:

Example from fish shell:
- `$ FORMAT=Nameofformat npm run generate-format`

Once you run this, under `ext-src/packages` you'll see a new folder created with stub files for creating a format! Have fun!
